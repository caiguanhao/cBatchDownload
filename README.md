## cBatchDownload
cBatchDownload makes it easier to use [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/) to batch download files from a list of links extracted from a file using a [regular expression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). This program mainly uses [GTK+](http://www.gtk.org/) (as interface), [PCRE](http://www.pcre.org/) (as regular expression library) and [POSIX Threads](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads).
